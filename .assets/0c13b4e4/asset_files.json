The design includes three slider controls for adjusting speed (20), pitch (550), and volume (80), along with playback controls (play, pause, stop) and a settings button. The interface uses a monospace font (JetBrains Mono) and maintains a consistent white background with black borders and accents."}], "all_inputs_processed": true, "next_steps": "Ready for implementation by other agents"}
